# neoc â€” An alternative implementation of the 'C Standard Library'

## Code style guide

- Use 2-space indenting, and no tabs.
- Multiline comments using `/*` is preferred and single line comments using `//`
  is also allowed.
- The opening brace `{` continues on the same line and the closing brace `}` is
  indented to match the start of the line.
- The maximum code line length is 80 characters.
- The pointer operator `*` is always preceded and succeeded by a space except
  when used for dereferencing.
- Use C style Doxygen comments in the code for automatic documentation
  generation.
- When in doubt please consult the source code existing in the repository.
